### MPCHonestMajorityForSPDZ
The extension is actually a bridge to the [MPCHonestMajorityForSPDZ](https://github.com/cryptobiu/MPCHonestMajorityForSpdz)
implementation of the protocol. This implementation also adds Mersenne127 primes to the original implementation,
and some additional chanegs to better support the interface to SPDZ
